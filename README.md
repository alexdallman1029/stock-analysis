# Green Stocks Analysis
## Overview
### Background
A client, Steve, is interested in obtaining stock information to make an informed decision about what "green" stocks to invest in for his parents based on the total daily volume and return on the stock for a given year. He wants to expand an existing dataset of 12 stocks to include the entire stock market over the last few years. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to refactor exsiting code to make analyzing stock outcome by year more efficient and applicable to an expanded data set using VBA code in Excel.
